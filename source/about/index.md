I'm James Andrew Vaughn (Andy). At a young age, I cut my programming teeth on [TI BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI_BASIC_(TI_99/4A)). During a time when a floppy disk drive would have cost an 8 year old kid a cool $1000 USD, a box of cassette tapes led me down a path that I am still on to this day.

In my teenage years, my technical interests (originally devoted to figuring out how to play computer games for free) and early access to bulletin board systems and [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) connected me with like-minded individuals in Canada and Europe. I spent much of my free time learning Pascal, and later C/C++, to contribute to the hacker zeitgeist developing in Northern Europe: {% post_link the-demoscene 'the Demoscene' %}. The development of business on the web pulled me in many different directions, but ultimately my areas of primary focus became network and communication performance, identity and access management, and rearchitecting legacy systems.

Today, I enjoy two different sides of technology: implementation _and_ leveraging it to solve real problems - particularly those that are presently underserved by technology. I have a passion for home computers, UNIX workstations, and keyboard synthesizers from the 1980s and 1990s.

At this time, I am...
