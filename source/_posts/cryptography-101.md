At the end of every two-week [MindTouch Engineering](https://mindtouch.com) sprint, [Patty Ramert](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pramert) hosts _Last Sprint Today_: a chance for us to share with other MindTouchers what we've learned, anything we are working on, or any technical topic of interest. This week, I presented an introduction to basic Cryptography, with some specific emphasis put on authorization and authentication flows.
