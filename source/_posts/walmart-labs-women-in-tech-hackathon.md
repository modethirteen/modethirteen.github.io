I was honored to co-host the [@WalmartLabs hackathon](https://www.hackathon.com/event/walmart-labs-react-hackathon-35213462414) this past weekend. @WalmartLabs is the e-commerce technology arm of the largest retailer in the United States. Being an unabashed supporter of organizations like [FC St. Pauli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_St._Pauli), it's only natural that some may view my association here as questionable or perhaps even hypocritical. I likely would not have been _overly_ enthusiastic about the arrangement if it wasn't for the fact that it was executed by a strong group of women engineers within Walmart Labs. Don't let achieving perfection of global economic equity be the enemy of great recruiting opportunities for a historically marginalized gender in the tech space ðŸ˜‰. No organization is perfect, but from what I've observed, and learned since the hackathon, @WalmartLabs actually executes on the promises of inclusion that so many companies in our space continue to profess.

Hackathons aren't easy to pull off - and it's important not to try to do too much. If the event is focused on promoting or leveraging specific tools (this particular event was promoting @WalmartLabs [Electrode](http://www.electrode.io/) React/Node.js framework), familiarity and training with the tools _before_ a competition is underway is a must-have. For those of you planning an event, consider a scripted challenge with a clear result or outcome to achieve, using the promoted technology. Future hackathons, with increasingly more breadth and positioned to developers that develop mastery of the chosen technology, can build a dedicated community and strong advocates for the tech in the industry.
