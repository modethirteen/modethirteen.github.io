"#KANMF" entered the [MindTouch](https://mindtouch.com) lexicon last year as an unofficial company motto (along with our "no douchebags" policy):

- Kick
- Ass
- Ninja
- Mother
- Fu...

...you get the idea. MindTouch has operated very lean for quite some time, and has always tried to hire people that help the organization punch above its weight class: those that see the limits on money, time, and resources as a challenge to get the blood pumping. I've had the occasional run-in with former technical colleagues that moved on to more established firms (Apple, Google, etc), and the common (paraphrased) refrain is this: "the results may not yet be exposed to the widest audience, but I did the best work of my career when I had to perform like a code ninja - gaining mastery across _the entire_ surface area of the platform". Point is, if that's what you are looking for, you _probably_ aren't going to find it in [big tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech).

Some of the sales staff ran with the ninja concept and long story short, now we have [swords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokken) üôÑ. As playful as it is, I do have somewhat mixed feelings about these weapons knocking about the office, without at least a demonstration of how dangerous they can be. I've trained with, and taught at, [Pacific Martial Arts](https://www.pmakarate.com), for many years, with [Shind≈ç Mus≈ç-ry≈´](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shint%C5%8D_Mus%C5%8D-ry%C5%AB) as a significant focus during the last several (I'm very much still an amateur with the bokken):

_Update 2019-11-13_: I had the opportunity to demonstrate Shindo recently, giving it the level of decorum that a martial art deserves:
