_Updated 2019-08-01_: In this video, I positioned the OAuth and OpenID Connect Implicit Flow as an implementation strategy for single-page web applications. Going forward, the new [PKCE flow](https://oauth.net/2/pkce) should be used for any new implementations involving public clients such as mobile applications and SPAs. Check out [this Okta developer blog article](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/05/01/is-the-oauth-implicit-flow-dead) for more details.

At the end of every two-week [MindTouch Engineering](https://mindtouch.com) sprint, [Patty Ramert](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pramert) hosts _Last Sprint Today_: a chance for us to share with other MindTouchers what we've learned, anything we are working on, or any technical topic of interest. This week, I presented an introduction into the differences between three common authorization and authentication standards for Single Sign-On.
