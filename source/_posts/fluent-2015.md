- With the assistance of the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org), [io.js](https://github.com/nodejs/iojs.org) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) will join a community-led and industry-backed consortium to lead the development of Node.js (essentially _healing_ the fork)

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org) seems to be a proper application of the functional programming aspects of JavaScript that I actually like

- PHP takes further steps towards a Java-like syntax with [PHP 7](https://www.php.net/releases/7_0_0.php)
