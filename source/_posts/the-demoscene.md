_Update 2020-11-26_: [Interesting companion piece I found from Motherboard (Vice)](https://www.vice.com/en/article/j5wgp7/who-killed-the-american-demoscene-synchrony-demoparty) that touches on a point that I made about the lethargy of the North American Demoscene.

At the end of every two-week [MindTouch Engineering](https://mindtouch.com) sprint, [Patty Ramert](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pramert) hosts _Last Sprint Today_: a chance for us to share with other MindTouchers what we've learned, anything we are working on, or any technical topic of interest. This week, I presented a primer on the [Demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene), which may be better described as "hackers gone wild" ðŸ˜‚.
