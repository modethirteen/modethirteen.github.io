After ten years of constantly harassing our product managers or leadership for hard evidence of market problems or customer need, MindTouch CTO, Steve Bjorg, suggested that my software engineering background may be better suited for technical product management.

It was a pretty altruistic move on his part, as he was essentially giving up his most tenured software architect (Hi Steve) and sending me off to the dark-side of product management. You know who product managers are, right? They're the ones in your organization who write those insanely detailed product requirements to the point where engineers don't know if their job is to actually develop solutions.
